Day 2: Building My First Flask App with Docker – DevOps Journey Begins

\---

🧠 Description (For Hashnode SEO):

Today I containerized my first Python Flask application using Docker. I learned how to write a Dockerfile, run a container, and understand the importance of \_\_name\_\_ in Flask. Follow along my DevOps journey from scratch!

\# 🚀 Day 2: Building My First Flask App with Docker

Hey everyone! 👋

Welcome to \*\*Day 2\*\* of my DevOps learning journey. I'm sharing everything I learn each day as I move toward my goal of becoming a DevOps engineer. Today, I built my first Flask application and containerized it using Docker.

\---

\## 🔧 What I Did Today

I created a small Flask web application, then used Docker to containerize and run it. This is my first step toward understanding how apps run in isolated environments — something essential in DevOps.

\---

\## 📁 Project Structure

flask-docker-app/ ├── app.py ├── requirements.txt └── Dockerfile

\---

\## 🧠 app.py Code

\`\`\`python

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(\_\_name\_\_)

@app.route('/')

def home():

return "🚀 Hello from Flask inside Docker on EC2!"

if \_\_name\_\_ == '\_\_main\_\_':

app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)

\&gt; I learned the difference between \_\_name\_\_ and --name--, and why it's important to write it properly.

\---

📦 Dockerfile

FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt

COPY app.py app.py

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

EXPOSE 5000

CMD \["python", "app.py"\]

\---

⚙️ How I Built and Ran the Image

docker build -t flask-py .

docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-py

Then I opened my browser and visited:

http://localhost:5000

✅ My app worked!

\---

💡 Key Learnings

Flask basics and routing

Difference between Flask(\_\_name\_\_) vs Flask(--name--)

Docker basics: image, container, ports

How to write a Dockerfile

\---

🔜 Next Steps (Tomorrow)

Deploy this Docker app on AWS EC2

Learn to SSH into EC2 and run containers

Link GitHub and LinkedIn to showcase the project

\---

💬 Final Thoughts

Even though I come from a system administration background, learning Docker and Flask felt very exciting. I now understand how containers work and why they’re so useful in DevOps pipelines.
