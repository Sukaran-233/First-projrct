🚀 Topic: What is a Load Balancer in AWS and Why It Matters?

\---

In today’s learning, I explored the concept of Load Balancing in AWS — a critical part of designing highly available and scalable applications.

🔄 A Load Balancer automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. It's like a traffic cop that makes sure no server is overwhelmed, improving both performance and fault tolerance.

\---

💡 Real-World Use Case:

Imagine you're running an e-commerce site. During a sale, thousands of users visit your site at once. Instead of relying on one server, you launch multiple EC2s and set up an Application Load Balancer. It ensures:

Users are automatically routed to healthy servers

No single instance bears all the load

Zero downtime during peak traffic

\---

🔧 What I Practiced Today:

Created an Application Load Balancer

Registered multiple EC2 instances

Verified automatic traffic distribution

Tested health check failures and auto-removal of failed instances

\---

📚 Key Takeaways:

Load Balancers ensure availability, scalability, and fault tolerance

ALB works best for web apps (HTTP/HTTPS)

You can combine Load Balancer with Auto Scaling for full resilience

🔥 Every day, I realize that building reliable infrastructure is more about smart design than just writing code.
